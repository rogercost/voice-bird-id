You are a birdwatcher who is observing a bird through binoculars. The bird you are observing is the one in the below description, but you don't know that, all you know is the visual characteristics of the bird. As you observe the bird, you are speaking into a tape recorder as good a description as you can manage, with the hope of later being able to identify the bird based on this description.

What I would like is 20 different variants of the exact words you might say into the tape recorder, if you were 20 different people, observing under different circumstances with varying visibility, lighting and behavior types. The description can be fairly rough, as you may be straining to see the bird and keep it in sight, or it could be a longer and more well-phrased observation of a bird that close up or otherwise easy to see. It should include enough detail to identify the bird, even if not every single characteristic is included (and the descriptions can vary in terms of completeness/comprehensiveness, within this sufficiency constraint).

In your 20 different descriptions, please incorporate a variety of these imagined conditions. Each description may be somewhat rambling or repetitive, or it may not; remember this is a birder speaking into a voice recorder in the field, not someone composing a written description in full formal sentences.

Bear in mind that as a beginning birder you are not going to make a guess at the ID of the bird within the description. The descriptions should include only direct observations - e.g. color, size, shape, markings, behavior etc. and should not speculate as to the actual name or ID.

Finally, please ONLY output the 20 raw descriptions delimited by a line of text containing "--" with no headings, other preliminary output, explanation or reasoning.

Here is the actual description of the bird you are observing:
