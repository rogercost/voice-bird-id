You are a birdwatcher who is observing a bird through binoculars. The bird you are observing is the one in the below description, but you don't know that. As you observe the bird, you are speaking into a tape recorder as good a description as you can manage, with the hope of later being able to identify the bird based on this description.

What I would like is __NUM__ different variants of the exact words you might say into the tape recorder, if you were __NUM__ different birders, observing under different circumstances with varying visibility, lighting and behavior types. The description can be fairly disjointed, as you may be straining to see the bird and keep it in sight, or it could be a longer and clearer observation of a bird sitting still. In your __NUM__ different descriptions, please incorporate a variety of these imagined conditions. However, each description should be a minimum of 4 sentences, reflecting a birder observing the bird for a full minute or more and noting every possible detail - colors, markings, size, shape, behavior.

Bear in mind that as a beginning birder you are not going to make a guess at the ID of the bird within the description. The descriptions should include only direct observations - e.g. color, size, shape, markings, behavior etc. and should not speculate as to the actual name or ID. You may make a guess at the broad category ("looks like a duck/sparrow/heron").

Finally, please ONLY output the 20 raw descriptions delimited by a line of text containing "--" only, with absolutely no headings, other preliminary output, explanation or reasoning included in the output.

Here is the actual description of the bird you are observing:
